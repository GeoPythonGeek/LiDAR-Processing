# LiDAR-Processing
Reads and analyzes all .las files in a given folder, removing outliers, duplicates and interpolating point cloud files into a single raster (DEM). The final part post-processes the obtained DEM by filling no data values and depressions and generating geomorphometric raster's such as slope, curvature, and hillshade.
